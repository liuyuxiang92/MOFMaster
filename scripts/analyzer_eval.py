"""Batch-evaluate the MOF-Scientist analyzer via the running LangServe endpoint.

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/analyzer_eval.py --out data/evals
  uv run python scripts/analyzer_eval.py --base-url http://localhost:8000 --out data/evals --cases quick

This script is intentionally lightweight: it sends prompts, saves raw JSON responses,
then prints a short summary focusing on analyzer/supervisor behavior.
